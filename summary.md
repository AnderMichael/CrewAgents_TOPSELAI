Chapter 5: MatemÃ¡ticas provides essential concepts and techniques that can be applied in programming contests and computational applications. It covers a range of mathematical topics that include:

1. **Progressions**: 
   - **Aritmetical & Geometric Progressions**: Basic concepts to understand sequences of numbers.
   - The sum of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric progression is given by \( S_n = \frac{a(1 - r^n)}{1 - r} \) for \( r > 1 \).

2. **Polynomials**: 
   - Operations include evaluation, differentiation, multiplication, or polynomial division.
   - Polynomials can be represented efficiently using their coefficients.

3. **Logarithms and Exponentiation**: 
   - Problems often involve the use of \( \log() \) and \( \exp() \) functions.

4. **Combinatorial Mathematics**:
   - Topics such as factorials, binomial coefficients, Fibonacci sequences, and Catalan numbers are discussed.

5. **Number Theory**:
   - Includes prime numbers and methods like the Sieve of Eratosthenes and the Miller-Rabin primality test.

6. **Mathematical Functions**:
   - Euler's totient function, greatest common divisor, least common multiple, as well as extended Euclidean algorithms.
   - Diophantine equations are also addressed.

7. **Game Theory**:
   - Concepts like zero-sum games, decision trees, and perfect play strategies are explored.

8. **Applications**:
   - Mathematical problems are often presented in practical ways that relate to real-world scenarios, aiming for problem-solving efficiency in competitive programming contexts.

These mathematical concepts are vital for building robust algorithms and can be easily implemented in a FastAPI application to solve various computational problems. Understanding these principles can vastly improve problem-solving skills in programming contests.
